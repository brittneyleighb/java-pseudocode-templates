# ðŸ“Œ What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a step-by-step description of an algorithm or program written in plain language that looks similar to programming code, but isnâ€™t bound by any specific syntax rules.  

Itâ€™s used to plan and explain logic before writing actual code in a programming language (like Java).

These are templates for writing psuedocode in Java!

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points
- **Not real code** â†’ the computer canâ€™t run it.  
- **Close to code style** â†’ uses structures like *IF, ELSE, FOR, WHILE, RETURN*.  
- **Easy to read** â†’ written for humans, not machines.  
- **Bridges the gap** between plain English and Java/Python/C++.

## ðŸ”¹ Example

**Plain English:**  
> "If a person is 18 or older, say they are an adult. Otherwise, say they are a minor."

**Pseudocode:**
```java
If age >= 18
Display "Adult"
Else
Display "Minor"
```

**Java Code:**
```java
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("Minor");
}
```
